# geodesic-aws-atlantis [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/geodesic-aws-atlantis.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic-aws-atlantis/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Deploy the Atlantis Server with ECS Fargate. This should be used as a git submodule with [`geodesic`](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic).

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

### Write secrets to Chamber

Atlantis will be invoked with chamber to expose the secrets as environment variables.

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to write the parameters to the same region as your ECS tasks.

```
# Allow atlantis to process `atlantis.yaml`
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_ALLOW_REPO_CONFIG true

# Set the log verbosity
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_LOG_LEVEL debug

# Set the listen port for atlantis
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_PORT 4141

# Set the atlantis webhook base URL
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_ATLANTIS_URL https://atlantis.ourcomain.com

# Set the GitHub user corresponding to the personal access token
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_GH_USER outcompanybot

# Set the GitHub personal access token corresponding to the github user
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_GH_TOKEN the-token-generated-by-github

# Set the WebHook callback secret
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET $(uuidgen)

# Set the permitted repositories
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_REPO_WHITELIST 'github.com/cloudposse/*'

# Permissions granted to teams
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_GH_TEAM_WHITELIST engineering:plan,testing:*

# Configuration this atlantis server will monitor
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_REPO_CONFIG atlantis/testing.yaml

# Command that atlantis will watch for
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_WAKE_WORD atlantis/testing

# Docker image to use with ECS
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_IMAGE cloudposse/testing.cloudposse.co:dev

# ACM Certificate domain
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_DOMAIN ourcompany.com

# ACM Alternative name
chamber write atlantis ATLANTIS_HOSTNAME atlantis.ourcompany.com

# Stage that we're operating under
chamber write atlantis STAGE testing

```


### Deploy Atlantis on ECS Fargate

This commands are asynchronous. You may need to retry them multiple times. 

```
chamber exec atlantis -- make create/iam-role
chamber exec atlantis -- make create/certificate
chamber exec atlantis -- make validate/certificate
chamber exec atlantis -- make create/lb
chamber exec atlatnis -- make create/service
```
